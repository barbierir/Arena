# Assets Placeholder Directory

This project intentionally does **not** commit binary assets.

Before running the UI with full visuals, add your own local placeholder files in this folder with these exact names:

- `bg-arena.jpg` or `bg-arena.png`
- `recruit-1.gif`
- `recruit-2.gif`
- `recruit-3.gif`
- `train.gif`
- `rest.gif`
- `fight-left.gif`
- `fight-right.gif`
- `crowd-loop.gif` (optional)

The frontend already references these file paths; missing files will simply show broken images until placeholders are added.
